**Overview:**
  DecoSwitch is an innovative home automation project designed to efficiently control multiple appliances using a minimal number of switches. By leveraging a decoder and a microcontroller, this system significantly reduces the number of physical switches required, optimizing space while maintaining full control over connected appliances.

**How It Works:**
  A microcontroller acts as the central processing unit, managing inputs and controlling the decoder.
A decoder receives control signals from a set of switches, translating them into multiple output signals.
If the decoder has n inputs, it can generate 2ⁿ outputs, allowing control of 2ⁿ appliances with just n switches.
This architecture drastically minimizes the number of switches needed, reducing space consumption and complexity.

**Key Benefits**
- Space Optimization – Reduces the number of switches required for appliance control.
- Scalability – Easily expand control by increasing decoder inputs.
- Efficiency – Simplifies wiring and installation, making it ideal for smart home and industrial applications.
- Microcontroller-Based – Ensures flexibility and easy integration with IoT and automation systems.

**Applications**
Smart Home Automation – Control multiple lights, fans, and other appliances with fewer switches.
Industrial Control Systems – Efficiently manage multiple devices in factories and offices.
Embedded Systems Projects – A practical demonstration of decoder-based logic control.
Future Enhancements
- Integration with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for remote control.
- Adding a touchscreen or voice control interface.
- Implementing smart scheduling and automation via software.
