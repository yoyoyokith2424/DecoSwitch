**Overview**
DecoSwitch is an innovative home automation project designed to efficiently control multiple appliances using a minimal number of switches. By leveraging a decoder and a microcontroller, this system significantly reduces the number of physical switches required, optimizing space while maintaining full control over connected appliances.

**How It Works**
A microcontroller acts as the central processing unit, managing inputs and controlling the decoder.
A decoder receives control signals from a set of switches, translating them into multiple output signals.
If the decoder has n inputs, it can generate 2ⁿ outputs, allowing control of 2ⁿ appliances with just n switches.
This architecture drastically minimizes the number of switches needed, reducing space consumption and complexity.
**Key Benefits**
✅ Space Optimization – Reduces the number of switches required for appliance control.
✅ Scalability – Easily expand control by increasing decoder inputs.
✅ Efficiency – Simplifies wiring and installation, making it ideal for smart home and industrial applications.
✅ Microcontroller-Based – Ensures flexibility and easy integration with IoT and automation systems.

**Applications**
Smart Home Automation – Control multiple lights, fans, and other appliances with fewer switches.
Industrial Control Systems – Efficiently manage multiple devices in factories and offices.
Embedded Systems Projects – A practical demonstration of decoder-based logic control.
Future Enhancements
🔹 Integration with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for remote control.
🔹 Adding a touchscreen or voice control interface.
🔹 Implementing smart scheduling and automation via software.
